### üéØ 1. Project Objective & Main Purpose

The core objective is to replace fragmented data systems (spreadsheets, siloed databases) with a **Unified Data Engine (RDBMS)**.

The **Main Purpose** is to enable **Data-Driven Operations** to achieve three critical business outcomes:

1.  **Risk Mitigation:** Instantly flag financial overruns and operational shortages (e.g., low material stock).
2.  **Efficiency:** Automate complex reporting and ensure 100% data integrity for transactions.
3.  **Profit Maximization:** Gain a holistic view of profitability by linking construction costs to sales revenue.

### üåê 2. Architecture and Scope

The system is built on a normalized SQL schema covering over 15 interconnected tables across two primary business domains:

| Domain | Key Data Managed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | Projects, Sites, Materials, Contractors, Vendors, Budgets |
| **Real Estate** | Property Listings, Clients, Sales, Agents, Leads, Feedback |
| **Integration Point** | Financial records (Budget vs. Final Sale Price) |

### ‚ú® 3. Key Features and Business Value

The project implements advanced SQL techniques across five phases, delivering specific, actionable insights:

| Feature Category | Technical Implementation | Business Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Control** | `WHERE StockQuantity < 100`, `Budget > AVG(Budget)` | **Instant Alerts** for material shortages and budget anomalies. |
| **Automation** | `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE PROCEDURE` (with Cursors) | Automates reports (e.g., `OngoingProjects`) and bulk tasks (e.g., updating budgets by location). |
| **Financial Integrity** | **TCL (`START TRANSACTION/COMMIT`)** | Guarantees that financial records (Payments and Purchase Order updates) are never half-completed. |
| **Advanced Analytics**| **Window Functions (`RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`)** | Ranks projects by cost, agent performance by rating, and tracks cumulative spending over time. |
| **Security** | **DCL (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)** | Protects sensitive data by controlling user access to tables like `Employees` and `Sales`. |

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Technologies Used

* **Database:** SQL (MySQL/similar RDBMS)
* **Concepts:** Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), Transaction Control Language (TCL), Data Control Language (DCL), Stored Procedures, Views, User-Defined Functions (UDFs), Window Functions.

### üöÄ 5. Project Impact & Future Scope

#### **Impact**

* **100% Data Integration:** Complete unification of construction and sales data.
* **Operational Excellence:** Improved query efficiency and continuous data quality assurance.
* **Robust Blueprint:** Provides a scalable foundation for future digital expansion.

#### **Future Scope**

1.  **Business Intelligence (BI) Integration:** Connect the SQL system to tools like **Power BI** or Tableau for visual, interactive dashboards.
2.  **Triggers:** Implement database triggers for automated data validation (e.g., auto-update project status when all properties are marked as sold).
